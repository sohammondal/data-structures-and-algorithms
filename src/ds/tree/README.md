# TREES ðŸŒ³ ðŸŒ²

**REAL LIFE EXAMPLES**
- HTML Page 
- Chess Games (before ML) used Tree DS to make decisions
- [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Fritzson/publication/228792639/figure/fig1/AS:393782852898820@1470896556105/Abstract-syntax-tree-of-the-while-loop.png)
- Comments on Facebook
- Linked List - a type of Tree DS but with linear path

## TYPES

**BINARY TREE**
- FULL OR PERFECT BINARY TREE 
    - every node other than the leaves has two children
    - number of nodes on the last level = number of nodes on all the other levels + 1<br>

    - *How to calculate the number of nodes?*<br>
        **Level 0**: 2^0 = 1<br>
        **Level 1**: 2^1 = 2<br>
        **Level 2**: 2^2 = 4<br>
        **Level 3**: 2^3 = 8<br>
    - *How to calculate the total number of nodes?* <small>(s - steps)</small> <br>
        **2^s - 1**<br>
        The above PBT has 4 steps, so no. of nodes = 2^4-1 = 15
    - **no. of nodes = 2^s - 1**<br>
      **log nodes = s** <small>(ignoring constant 1)</small> <br>

- COMPLETE BINARY TREE
    - every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled
    - all nodes are as far left as possible<br>
