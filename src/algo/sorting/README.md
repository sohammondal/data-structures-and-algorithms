### Elementary Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort - Useful than Bubble/Selection if the input array/list is nearly sorted.

### Advanced Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort

## Stable vs Unstable Algorithms
<small>Source: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517793/what-is-stability-in-sorting-algorithms-and-why-is-it-important">StackOverflow</a></small>

- A stable algorithm sorts the identical elements in their same order as they appear in the input,whilst unstable sorting may not satisfy the case.

- Stable Sorting Algorithms:
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Tim Sort
    - Counting Sort

- Unstable Sorting Algorithms:
    - Heap Sort
    - Selection sort
    - Shell sort
    - Quick Sort
